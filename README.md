# DXF Converter Prototype

This prototype was build to experiment and test out our ideas for uploading, manipulating, and exporting changes to [DXF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF) files. This prototype runs completely in the browser. Future versions will be accompanied by a deployable server.

## Demo
See this [example](https://jdrfelectromag.github.io/dxf-converter-ui-prototype/). 

**Note:** If you've viewed this previously and the demo code has changed, you may need to hard-refresh your browser as the resource names may have changed. 

## Usage
You can view the online demo above. If you want to run this locally, you can clone this repo and simply open `/docs/index.html` in your browser. Note that this was only tested in Firefox and Chrome. Safari will _not_ work at this time. IE and Edge probably will not work either.

### Running Locally
Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies. 

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the app locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests
To run tests in watch mode, run `npm run test` or `yarn test`. To run the full suite of checks, run `npm run verify` or `yarn verify`.
